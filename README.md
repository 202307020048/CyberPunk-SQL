## 📜 How to Use CyberPunk-SQL

### 1️⃣ Setting up the SQL Query Environment

To get started with writing SQL queries in the project, follow these steps:

- Open the file `holo-sql.html` in your browser.
- This will launch a custom SQL query environment where you can interact with the game.
- To create the necessary database structure for the game, copy the commands from `create-table.txt` and paste them directly into the query window in **holo-sql**.
- Run these SQL commands to create the required tables and prepare the environment for the game.

### 2️⃣ Starting the Project

- Open `index.html` to start the story and dive into the world of CyberPunk-SQL.
- Interact with the SQL query environment via `holo-sql.html` to complete the challenges and advance the storyline.
